# StellingBanjos

The StellingBanjos gem provides the user with a list of Stelling Banjos (the best banjos) for sale
from the website https://www.elderly.com using a CLI. The catelog displays each banjo name, the price,
and whether or not it is in stock.

The user can then make a specific banjo selection to view more information about a banjo and can follow
a link to the specific banjo webpage.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stelling_banjos'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install stelling_banjos

## Usage

Start the CLI by entering "banjo" into the terminal.

## Development
